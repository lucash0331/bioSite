  <p>Kali Sky is a 28-year-old animal lover from the great state of Georgia. Kali grew up in an upper-class 
    family and has 3 brothers and 2 sisters. Growing up, Kali was always captivated by animals, and this led to
     her having a dog, snake and a guinea pig as pets. In Kali’s free time you can catch her playing with her 
     daughter, bonding with her puppy or relaxing at the beach. She graduated high school from Buford high school
      in 2012. After completing high school, she attended Georgia State University, graduating in 2016 with a
       degree in Journalism. During college Kali worked for WSB-TV Atlanta and WXIA-TV. Shortly after graduating
        college, Kali gave birth to a beautiful girl named Skyler.  After two years of working on camera in the
         news industry, Kali felt like she was not fulfilling her life’s calling of helping people. First, she
          started working at the YMCA focusing on guiding troubled youth in the right direction. Even after 
          helping numerous people succeed she still felt a void in her heart, forcing her to find more meaningful
          work. Shortly after the YMCA, Kali started working for a non- profit organization called Must Ministries.
          During her time at Must Ministries, Kali raised over 1 million dollars to help feed starving children in
           the Metro Atlanta area. After a year on the job, Kali came to the conclusion that she wanted to be a 
           first responder. After comparing and contrasting different jobs in that field, Kali knew right away that
            she wanted to be an Emergency Medical Technician. She attended a brutal 6-month long EMT school at Grady
             EMS Academy. Currently, Kali is working as a licensed EMT in the Atlanta suburbs and is loving every
              second of it!</p>
